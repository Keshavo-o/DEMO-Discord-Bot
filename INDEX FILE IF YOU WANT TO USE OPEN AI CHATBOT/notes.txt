You can integrate your Discord bot with an OpenAI chatbot (or any other chatbot) to function as a real-time conversational bot.
You will need an API key from OpenAI, which can be generated from their website.
However, in many cases, it may not work without a premium subscription to the OpenAI model.
You must write your OpenAI API key in the code.json file.
